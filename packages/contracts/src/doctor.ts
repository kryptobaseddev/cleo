 *   - Worktrees outside the canonical XDG location
 *   - Rogue `.cleo/worktrees/` DIRECTORY (council D009 — only .json sentinel allowed)
 *
 * Consumed by:
 *   - `packages/core/src/doctor/worktree-orphans.ts` (scan + prune primitives)
 *   - `packages/cleo/src/cli/commands/doctor.ts` (CLI flags)
