# DEPRECATED: EPIC-CREATOR.md

> **This template has been deprecated and merged into EPIC-ARCHITECT.md**

## Redirect

Please use: `templates/orchestrator-protocol/subagent-prompts/EPIC-ARCHITECT.md`

## Rationale

- EPIC-ARCHITECT.md scores 96.7% on Claude subagent guidelines (vs 70%)
- EPIC-ARCHITECT.md has proper YAML frontmatter for auto-discovery
- EPIC-ARCHITECT.md provides comprehensive educational content
- All template variables have been merged into EPIC-ARCHITECT.md
- 65% content overlap made maintaining both templates a burden

## Migration

No changes needed. EPIC-ARCHITECT.md contains all functionality:
- Template variables ({FEATURE_NAME}, {SESSION_ID}, {OUTPUT_DIR}, {EPIC_ID}, {PHASE}, etc.)
- Context section for injection
- Complete CLEO command examples
- Task decomposition guidance
- RFC 2119 subagent protocol compliance
