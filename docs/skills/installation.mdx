# Skills Installation

CLEO skills are included with the standard installation. This guide covers configuration and customization.

<Note>
**2-Tier Architecture (v0.72.0+)**: CLEO uses a universal subagent architecture where skills are **protocol identifiers**, NOT separate agent types. All spawns use `cleo-subagent` with the selected skill as context injection. Skill names like `ct-research-agent` identify the protocol to load, not a different agent.
</Note>

## Included Skills

The following skills are installed automatically with CLEO:

| Skill | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Epic Architect | `skills/ct-epic-architect/` | Create comprehensive epics |
| Orchestrator | `skills/ct-orchestrator/` | Multi-agent coordination |
| Research Agent | `skills/ct-research-agent/` | Information gathering |
| Task Executor | `skills/ct-task-executor/` | Implementation workflows |
| Spec Writer | `skills/ct-spec-writer/` | Technical specifications |
| Test Writer | `skills/ct-test-writer-bats/` | BATS test creation |

## Verification

Check that skills are installed:

```bash
ls ~/.cleo/skills/
```

You should see directories for each skill:

```
ct-epic-architect/
ct-orchestrator/
ct-research-agent/
ct-task-executor/
ct-spec-writer/
ct-test-writer-bats/
```

## Using Skills in Claude Code

### Direct Reference

Reference a skill file in your prompt:

```
@~/.cleo/skills/ct-epic-architect/SKILL.md

Create an epic for implementing user authentication.
```

### Trigger Phrases

Skills activate automatically with trigger phrases:

```
"Create an epic for payment processing"
→ Activates Epic Architect

"Research the best practices for JWT tokens"
→ Activates Research Agent

"Orchestrate the implementation of the auth system"
→ Activates Orchestrator
```

## Configuration

### Skill Discovery

Skills are discovered from:

1. `~/.cleo/skills/` (global installation)
2. `.cleo/skills/` (project-local)
3. Paths in `skills.additionalPaths` config

### Adding Custom Skill Paths

```bash
cleo config set skills.additionalPaths '["./custom-skills", "~/team-skills"]'
```

### Disabling Skills

Disable specific skills:

```bash
cleo config set skills.disabled '["ct-research-agent"]'
```

## Skill Manifest

The `skills/manifest.json` defines available skills:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "skills": [
    {
      "id": "ct-epic-architect",
      "name": "Epic Architect",
      "path": "ct-epic-architect/SKILL.md",
      "triggers": ["create epic", "plan epic"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Updating Skills

Skills are updated with CLEO:

```bash
# Update CLEO installation (includes skills)
cd ~/.cleo && git pull

# Verify skill versions
cat ~/.cleo/skills/manifest.json | jq '.version'
```

## Creating Project-Local Skills

Add skills specific to your project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Directory">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .cleo/skills/my-project-skill
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create SKILL.md">
    ```bash
    cat > .cleo/skills/my-project-skill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
    ---
    name: "My Project Skill"
    description: "Project-specific workflow"
    version: "1.0.0"
    triggers:
      - "my workflow"
    ---

    # My Project Skill

    [Instructions...]
    EOF
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Skill">
    ```
    @.cleo/skills/my-project-skill/SKILL.md

    Execute my workflow for feature X.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Skill Not Found" icon="circle-exclamation">
    ```bash
    # Check skill exists

    # Verify SKILL.md is present
    cat ~/.cleo/skills/ct-epic-architect/SKILL.md | head -20
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Triggers Not Working" icon="bolt">
    Verify trigger phrases in skill frontmatter:

    ```bash
    grep -A5 "triggers:" ~/.cleo/skills/ct-epic-architect/SKILL.md
    ```

    Try explicit invocation:
    ```
    @~/.cleo/skills/ct-epic-architect/SKILL.md
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Outdated Skills" icon="clock">
    Update from git:
