# cleo start

Start working on a task - begin time tracking and set as current focus.

{% hint style="info" %}**Agent Relevance**: High - Essential for task work tracking{% endhint %}

## Synopsis

```bash
cleo start <task-id> [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

The `start` command marks a task as in-progress and begins tracking work time on it. This is the recommended way to begin work on a task, replacing the older `focus` command for task work management.

When you start a task:
- Task status changes to `in-progress` (if not already)
- Task becomes the "current" task for time tracking
- Previous current task (if any) is automatically stopped
- Work session tracking begins

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--note "TEXT"` | Add a note when starting the task |
| `--session-id ID` | Associate with specific session |
| `--json` | Output in JSON format |
| `--human` | Output in human-readable format |

## Examples

{% tabs %}

```bash Start a task
cleo start T1234
```

```bash Start with a note
cleo start T1234 --note "Beginning implementation phase"
```

```bash JSON output
cleo start T1234 --json
```

{% endtabs %}
