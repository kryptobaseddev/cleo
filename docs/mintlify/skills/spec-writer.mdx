# Spec Writer

The Spec Writer skill provides context injection for specification writing tasks, creating clear, unambiguous technical specifications using RFC 2119 language.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Skill ID** | ct-spec-writer |
| **Tier** | 2 (Execution) |
| **Protocol** | specification |
| **Tags** | specification, documentation, rfc |

## Capabilities

1. **Protocol Specifications** - Define behavior rules with RFC 2119 keywords
2. **Technical Requirements** - Document system requirements with constraints
3. **API Specifications** - Define interfaces, schemas, and contracts
4. **Architecture Documents** - Document system design decisions

## When to Use

The dispatch algorithm selects ct-spec-writer for:

- Tasks with keywords: `spec`, `rfc`, `protocol`, `contract`
- Tasks labeled: `specification`
- Task type: `specification`

## RFC 2119 Keywords

Specifications MUST use these keywords with their precise meanings:

| Keyword | Meaning | Expected Compliance |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **MUST** | Absolute requirement | 95-98% |
| **MUST NOT** | Absolute prohibition | 93-97% |
| **SHOULD** | Recommended unless good reason | 75-85% |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Discouraged unless good reason | 75-85% |
| **MAY** | Truly optional | 40-60% |

## Specification Structure

```markdown
# {Specification Title} v{X.Y.Z}

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Overview

{2-3 sentence summary of what this spec defines}

---

## Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| {term} | {definition} |

---

## Requirements

### {Category 1}

**REQ-001**: {Requirement description}
- Rationale: {Why this requirement exists}
- Verification: {How to verify compliance}

---

## Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Enforcement |
|----|------------|-------------|
| CON-001 | {constraint} | {how enforced} |

---

## Compliance

A system is compliant if:
1. {condition 1}
2. {condition 2}
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Be Precise

- Every requirement MUST be testable
- Avoid ambiguous terms ("appropriate", "reasonable", "adequate")
- Use specific values, not ranges when possible

### Be Complete

- Define all terms that might be misunderstood
- Cover error cases and edge conditions
- Specify what happens when requirements conflict

### Be Organized

- Group related requirements
- Use consistent numbering (REQ-XXX, CON-XXX)
- Cross-reference related sections

## Output Location

Specifications are written to: `developer/specifications/{{SPEC_NAME}}.mdx`

## Execution Flow

```
1. Read task details
   └─→ cleo show {{TASK_ID}}

2. Set focus (if needed)
   └─→ cleo focus set {{TASK_ID}}

3. Write specification
   └─→ developer/specifications/{{SPEC_NAME}}.mdx

4. Append manifest
   └─→ {{MANIFEST_PATH}}

5. Complete task
   └─→ cleo complete {{TASK_ID}}

6. Return summary
   └─→ "Specification complete. See MANIFEST.jsonl for summary."
```

## Manifest Entry

```json
{"id":"spec-{{SPEC_NAME}}-{{DATE}}","file":"{{DATE}}_spec-{{SPEC_NAME}}.md","title":"Specification: {{TITLE}}","date":"{{DATE}}","status":"complete","agent_type":"specification","topics":["specification"],"key_findings":["Defined N requirements in M categories","Established X constraints","Compliance criteria defined"],"actionable":true,"needs_followup":["{{IMPLEMENTATION_TASK_IDS}}"],"linked_tasks":["{{TASK_ID}}"]}
```
