# Release Management Specification

<Warning>
**DEPRECATED** (v0.83.1): This specification has been consolidated into `protocols/release.md`,
which is the single canonical reference for both LLM agents and human developers.
</Warning>

## Canonical Reference

**Agents**: Use `protocols/release.md` directly. It contains the complete release schema,
state machine, error codes, CLI commands, workflow, and platform changelog configuration.

**Humans**: See [Release Command Documentation](/commands/release) for usage examples,
or read `protocols/release.md` for the full technical reference.

## Archived Version

The full v2.0.0 specification is preserved at `archive/specs/deprecated/RELEASE-MANAGEMENT-SPEC.mdx`
for historical reference.

## What Moved Where

| Content | New Location |
|---------|-------------|
| Release JSON schema | `protocols/release.md` → Release Schema |
| State machine (3 states: planned/active/released) | `protocols/release.md` → State Machine |
| Error codes 50-59 | `protocols/release.md` → Error Codes |
| Task discovery pipeline | `protocols/release.md` → Task Discovery |
| CLI commands (8 real) | `protocols/release.md` → CLI Commands |
| Platform changelog config | `protocols/release.md` → Platform Changelog Configuration |
| Validation gates | `protocols/release.md` → Validation Gates |
| CI/CD integration | `protocols/release.md` → CI/CD Integration |

## Removed Content

- `cleo release verify` - use `cleo release ship --dry-run`
- `cleo release start` - state transition is automatic during `ship`
- `cleo release note` - use `cleo release plan --notes` or `cleo release create --notes`
- `active` state documentation - now correctly documented as transitional state in 3-state model
- `lib/changelog.sh` deprecation notice - incorrect, lib/changelog.sh is the primary generator
