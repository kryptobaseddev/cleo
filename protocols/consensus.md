## Output Format

### Voting Structure

```json
{
  "questionId": "CONS-001",
  "question": "Decision question being answered",
  "options": [
    {
      "option": "Option A description",
      "vote": "accept|reject|abstain",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "rationale": "Why this position",
      "evidence": [{"file": "path", "section": "name", "type": "code"}]
    }
  ],
  "verdict": "PROVEN|REFUTED|CONTESTED|INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE",
  "consensusThreshold": 0.8,
  "actualConsensus": 0.75
}
```

### Verdict Thresholds

| Verdict | Threshold | Evidence Requirement |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| **PROVEN** | 4/5 agents OR 80%+ weighted confidence | Reproducible evidence |
| **REFUTED** | Counter-evidence invalidates | Counter-proof exists |
| **CONTESTED** | 3/5 split after 2 challenge rounds | Document both sides |
| **INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE** | Cannot reach verdict | Request investigation |

### Conflict Structure

```json
{
  "conflictId": "conflict_a1b2c3d4",
  "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "conflictType": "contradiction|partial-overlap|scope-difference|priority-difference",
  "positions": [
    {"agentId": "opus-1", "position": "Position A", "confidence": 0.85},
    {"agentId": "sonnet-1", "position": "Position B", "confidence": 0.75}
  ],
  "resolution": {
    "status": "pending|proposed|accepted|rejected",
    "resolutionType": "merge|choose-a|choose-b|new|defer|escalate"
  }
}
```

### File Output

```markdown
# Consensus Report: {Decision Title}

**Task**: T####
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: complete|partial|blocked
**Agent Type**: analysis

---

## Decision Question

{Clear statement of what needs to be decided}

## Options Evaluated

### Option A: {Name}

**Confidence**: X.XX
**Rationale**: {Why this option}
**Evidence**: {Citations}
**Pros**: {Advantages}
**Cons**: {Disadvantages}

### Option B: {Name}

{Same structure}

## Voting Matrix

| Agent | Option A | Option B | Confidence | Notes |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| opus-1 | Accept | - | 0.85 | {Rationale} |
| sonnet-1 | - | Accept | 0.70 | {Rationale} |

## Verdict

**Result**: {PROVEN|REFUTED|CONTESTED|INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE}
**Consensus**: {X}% weighted agreement
**Recommendation**: {Final recommendation}

## Conflicts

{If any conflicts exist}

## Next Steps

### Manifest Entry

```json
{"id":"T####-consensus-slug","file":"YYYY-MM-DD_consensus.md","title":"Consensus: Decision Title","date":"YYYY-MM-DD","status":"complete","agent_type":"analysis","topics":["consensus","decision"],"key_findings":["Verdict reached","Option A selected","80% confidence"],"actionable":true,"needs_followup":[],"linked_tasks":["T####"]}
```

## Integration Points

### Base Protocol

- Inherits task lifecycle (focus, execute, complete)
- Inherits manifest append requirement
- Inherits error handling patterns

### Protocol Interactions

| Combined With | Behavior |
|---------------|----------|
| research | Research provides evidence for voting |
| specification | Consensus resolves spec ambiguities |
| contribution | Consensus validates contributions |

### HITL Escalation

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Contested verdict (3/5 split) | Present conflict to user |
| Critical severity conflict | Immediate escalation |
| Insufficient evidence | Request user guidance |
| Unanimous suspicious consensus | Verify with user |

---

## Example

**Task**: Decide on codebase map architecture

**Manifest Entry**:
```json
{"id":"T2216-arch-consensus","file":"2026-01-26_arch-consensus.md","title":"Consensus: Codebase Map Architecture","date":"2026-01-26","status":"complete","agent_type":"analysis","topics":["architecture","consensus","codebase-map"],"key_findings":["Single file selected over split","4/5 agents agree","Atomic operations priority"],"actionable":true,"needs_followup":["T2217"],"linked_tasks":["T2204","T2216"]}
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why Avoid |
|---------|-----------|
| Accepting unanimous consensus without scrutiny | May indicate groupthink |
| Skipping evidence citations | Decisions lack foundation |
| Binary voting without confidence | Loses nuance |
| Ignoring minority positions | May miss valid concerns |
| Premature escalation | Wastes human attention |
