/**
 * Doctor domain contracts — types for `cleo doctor` worktree-orphan audit/prune.

 * `<projectRoot>/.claude/worktrees/` by the T9550/T9580 SSoT bug (fixed in
 * v2026.5.83) and the schema for the audit JSONL line written per prune.
 *
 * Also contains the comprehensive worktree audit types (T9808) covering:
 *   - Orphan `.cleo/` dirs inside ANY git worktree (not just .claude/worktrees/)
 *   - Worktrees outside the canonical XDG location
 *   - Rogue `.cleo/worktrees/` DIRECTORY (council D009 — only .json sentinel allowed)
 *
 * Consumed by:
 *   - `packages/core/src/doctor/worktree-orphans.ts` (scan + prune primitives)
 *   - `packages/cleo/src/cli/commands/doctor.ts` (CLI flags)
