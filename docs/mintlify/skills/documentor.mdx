# Documentor

The Documentor skill provides context injection for documentation tasks, orchestrating specialized skills for lookup, writing, and review.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Skill ID** | ct-documentor |
| **Tier** | 3 (Support) |
| **Protocol** | implementation |
| **Tags** | documentation, orchestration |

## Skill Coordination

| Skill | Purpose | Invoke When |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `ct-docs-lookup` | Query existing docs, find references | Discovery phase |
| `ct-docs-write` | Create/edit docs with CLEO style | Writing content |
| `ct-docs-review` | Check compliance with style guide | Quality validation |

## Core Principle

> **MAINTAIN, DON'T DUPLICATE**

Before creating ANY new file:
1. Search for existing documentation on the topic
2. Identify the canonical location for this information
3. UPDATE the existing file instead of creating a new one
4. Only create new files when NO suitable location exists

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery (MANDATORY)

Before writing anything, discover what exists:

```bash
# List documentation structure
Glob: pattern="docs/**/*.md"

# Search for existing content
Grep: pattern="{TOPIC_KEYWORDS}" path="docs/"

# Check for related files
Grep: pattern="{RELATED_TERMS}" path="docs/" output_mode="files_with_matches"
```

### Phase 2: Assess

| Question | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Does a doc file for this topic exist? | UPDATE that file |
| Is the info scattered across files? | CONSOLIDATE |
| Is there a related doc that should include this? | ADD section |
| Is this truly new with no home? | CREATE minimal new file |

### Phase 3: Write/Update

**For EXISTING files:**
1. Read the current content
2. Identify the correct section
3. Add/update content IN PLACE
4. Preserve existing structure
5. Update any version numbers or dates

**For CONSOLIDATION:**
1. Identify all files with related content
2. Choose the canonical location
3. Move content to canonical file
4. Add deprecation notices to old locations

**For NEW files (last resort):**
1. Confirm no existing location is suitable
2. Follow project's doc structure conventions
3. Keep minimal - single topic focus

### Phase 4: Review

Checklist:
- [ ] No formal language ("utilize", "offerings")
- [ ] "People/companies" not "users"
- [ ] No excessive exclamation points
- [ ] Important information leads
- [ ] No verbose text without value
- [ ] Headings state the point
- [ ] Descriptive link text (never "here")
- [ ] No "easy" or "simple"
- [ ] Code examples work

## Anti-Duplication Checklist

Before completing, verify:

- [ ] Searched for existing docs on this topic
- [ ] Did NOT create duplicate content
- [ ] Updated existing file if one existed
- [ ] Added deprecation notice if consolidating
- [ ] Cross-references are updated
- [ ] No orphaned documentation created

## Output Format

```markdown
# Documentation Update: {TITLE}

**Date**: {DATE} | **Agent**: ct-documentor | **Status**: complete
