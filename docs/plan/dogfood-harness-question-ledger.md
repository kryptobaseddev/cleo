# Dogfood harness question ledger

## Goal

Keep hard dogfood questions visible until they are inherited by the North Star, converted into owned CLEO work, answered by BRAIN decisions, or explicitly rejected. MUST ALWAYS wrap sessions with What did you learn about cleo code this session while using it, any issues or hurddles around using it while you went through this process that you would like to see optimized or improved. it can be functionality in cleo, observations about its tool uses, bugs, skill instructions issues. Must focus on always iterating and improving while dogfooding using Cleo Code removing any friction an LLM agent has and improving the CORE harness API and TOOLS first NOT the CLI as the CLI is only an extension of the CORE API

## Ledger protocol

Each question MUST have:
- stable ID: `DHQ-###`
- owner surface: saga/epic/task that owns the answer
- answer vehicle: BRAIN decision, ADR, accepted plan, shipped PR, or cancelled-with-rationale task
- status: open, researching, decided, implemented, retired
- next review trigger: session start, saga completion, release failure, or North Star refresh

Durable architectural answers MUST be stored with `cleo memory decision-store` and linked to tasks. This document is an index, not the source of truth for decisions.

## Open questions captured from 2026-05-25 dogfood triage

### DHQ-001 — Worker state truth

Question: Why are agents still forced to infer worker state from worktree spelunking instead of an orchestrator dashboard?

Owner surface: `T10437` multi-agent observability.

Actionable tasks:
- `T10522` — Detect stalled dirty/unpushed worker worktrees.
- `T10523` — Surface DB/evidence lock contention and stale-lock cleanup guidance.

Answer vehicle: dashboard design + implementation tasks; later BRAIN decision if a state taxonomy is ratified.

Status: open / task-filed.

Next review trigger: before any next 5+ worker saga.

### DHQ-002 — Administrative closeout vs unsafe override

Question: Why does already-green administrative closeout still consume the same override path as unsafe bypass?

Owner surface: `T9496` / `T9505` override-cap cleanup, plus `T10437` observability.

Answer vehicle: BRAIN decision defining override taxonomy, then implementation task if accepted.

Status: open / mapped.

Next review trigger: next time `CLEO_OWNER_OVERRIDE` is needed for merged or already-green work.

### DHQ-003 — Release truth before tag/publish

Question: Why do release blockers show up after tag/publish instead of in preflight?

Owner surface: `T10431`, `T10434`, `T10436`, `T9758`, `T9761`.

Answer vehicle: release-readiness preflight + release provenance graph.

Status: open / partially owned.

Next review trigger: next release attempt or npm artifact inconsistency.

### DHQ-004 — Docs SSoT agent ergonomics

Question: Why does docs SSoT have correct architecture but an agent-hostile CLI and inconsistent publish/update model?

Owner surface: `T10516`.

Actionable epics:
- `T10517` — command surface and migration aliases.
- `T10518` — slug/latest owner-version SSoT repair.
- `T10519` — storage/query consolidation.
- `T10520` — decision-routing ergonomics.
- `T10521` — dogfood regression harness.

Answer vehicle: SG-DOCS-CLI-SIMPLIFICATION implementation plus regression tests.

Status: open / decomposed.

Next review trigger: before editing or publishing another canonical North Star doc.

### DHQ-005 — Baselines encode unstable coordinates

Question: Why are lint baselines tracking line numbers instead of stable semantic intent?

Owner surface: `T10232`.

Actionable task:
- `T10524` — Replace line-anchored lint baselines with content-addressed markers.

Answer vehicle: lint baseline migration and tests.

Status: open / task-filed.

Next review trigger: next line-shift-induced lint baseline churn.

### DHQ-006 — CLI truth and help drift

Question: Why can CLI help/error hints advertise flags or workflows that are not implemented?

Owner surface: `T10430` fixed one instance; `T10516` covers docs-specific drift; broader CLI contract should be inherited by North Star trust foundation.

Answer vehicle: regression tests comparing error hints/help examples to actual CLI parser surface.

Status: open / partially owned.

Next review trigger: any `E_UNKNOWN_FLAG` caused by an official hint, skill, or help text.

### DHQ-007 — AC binding forces override for green-gate non-code tasks

Question: Why do non-code tasks (content trim, external verification, .gitignore restructuring, CI config changes) need `CLEO_OWNER_OVERRIDE=1` even when ALL gates are green?

Owner surface: `T9496` / `T9505` override-cap cleanup (same as DHQ-002).

Observed: T10466, T10467, T10489, T10490 all had implemented/testsPassed/qaPassed green via `tool:lint` but `cleo complete` failed on AC bindings. The same commit+files+tool evidence that satisfied gates should auto-bind ACs.

Answer vehicle: BRAIN decision defining AC auto-binding from gate evidence when all gates green.

Status: open.

Next review trigger: next non-code task completion.

### DHQ-008 — T9175 worktree warning noise on non-spawned tasks

Question: Why does `cleo complete` emit `[T9175] worktree integration failed — Branch task/TXXXX does not exist` for every task that was never spawned via orchestrate spawn?

Owner surface: `T9175` worktree integration.

Observed: All 4 tasks completed today emitted this warning. Tasks completed outside the spawn path (manual edits, external verification) shouldn't emit scary worktree-failure warnings.

Answer vehicle: check if worktree was provisioned before warning; downgrade to INFO for no-worktree-history tasks.

Status: open.

Next review trigger: next `cleo complete` on a non-spawned task.

### DHQ-009 — CI perma-failure on main does not block releases

Question: Why does the release process ship when main CI has pre-existing failures (Rust Vendor Parity, Saga Label, DB Open Chokepoint, Invariants Docs Render)?

Owner surface: `T10434` / `T10436` release preflight, `DHQ-003` release truth before tag/publish.

Observed: CI on main has `conclusion=failure` across 3 consecutive commits (542cd5c23, 4103a3b8b, ebd937640). All 4 failures are tracked pre-existing technical debt unrelated to the hygiene sweep. Yet v2026.5.123 shipped successfully to NPM.

Answer vehicle: release-readiness preflight gate that checks main CI green before proceeding.

Status: open / mapped to DHQ-003.

Next review trigger: next release attempt.

## North Star inheritance rule

A question graduates into the North Star when it changes one of:
- tier sequencing
- saga ownership
- architectural doctrine
- safety/trust contract
- agent-facing workflow contract

Until then it remains in this ledger and in its owning task/saga.
