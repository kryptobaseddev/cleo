# CANT Language Reference

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Spec**: [`CANT-DSL-SPEC.md`](../specs/CANT-DSL-SPEC.md) | **Status**: Implemented

CANT (**C**LEO **A**gent **N**otation for **T**asks) is the non-prose DSL that powers the
CLEO ecosystem. It defines agents, skills, hooks, workflows, and pipelines in a structured,
parseable format with full LSP support.

---

## Why CANT?

CANT replaces prose-based agent instructions with a real language that has:

- **A real parser** (`cant-core`, Rust) -- not an LLM pretending to be a VM
- **A real LSP** (`cant-lsp`) -- diagnostics, completions, hover, go-to-definition
- **Static analysis** -- 42 validation rules catch errors before any LLM touches the file
- **Deterministic pipelines** -- shell commands with no LLM involvement at all
- **Minimal prose** -- prose only appears in session prompts and discretion conditions

The LLM is a tool invoked by the runtime, not the runtime itself.

---

## File Format

### Extension

All CANT files use the `.cant` extension. There are no compound extensions (`.cant.agent`,
`.cant.workflow`, etc.). The `kind:` frontmatter field determines the document type.

### Encoding and Indentation

- UTF-8 encoded, no BOM
- 2-space indentation (tabs rejected)
- Max file size: 1 MB
- Comments: `#` to end of line

### Document Modes

A `.cant` file operates in one of two modes:

| Mode | Trigger | Use |
|------|---------|-----|
| **Message mode** (Layer 1) | No frontmatter | Single CANT message: `/directive @addr T123 #tag` |
| **Document mode** (Layers 2-3) | Has `---` frontmatter | Agent definitions, workflows, pipelines |

---

## Frontmatter

Every document-mode `.cant` file begins with a YAML frontmatter block:

```cant
---
kind: workflow
version: 1
---
```

| Property | Required | Values |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `kind` | Yes | `agent`, `skill`, `hook`, `workflow`, `pipeline`, `config` |
| `version` | Yes | Schema version (currently `1`) |

The `kind` controls which top-level constructs are allowed:

| Kind | Allowed Constructs |
|------|-------------------|
| `agent` | `agent`, `on`, `@import`, `let` |
| `skill` | `skill`, `@import`, `let` |
| `hook` | `on`, `@import`, `let` |
| `workflow` | `workflow`, `pipeline`, `agent`, `@import`, `let` |
| `pipeline` | `pipeline`, `@import`, `let` |
| `config` | property assignments only |

---

## Three Layers, One Grammar

CANT is organized into three layers. All share one parser, one AST, and one grammar.

### Layer 1: Message Protocol

The original CANT -- structured messages between agents. This layer is **frozen**.

```cant
/done @all T1234 #shipped

## Phase A complete

Added assignee column. @versionguard-opencode see T5678.
```

Parsed elements:

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `/verb` | Directive (action, routing, or informational) |
| `@name` | Address (agent or group reference) |
| `T1234` | Task reference |
| `#tag` | Semantic tag |

Body text follows the header after a blank line. Addresses, task refs, and tags in the
body are extracted but not interpreted as directives.

### Layer 2: Instruction DSL

Defines **what agents, skills, and hooks ARE** -- structured properties, not paragraphs.

#### Agent Definition

```cant
---
kind: agent
version: 1
---

agent ops-lead:
  model: opus
  persist: project
  prompt: "You coordinate operations, never implement directly"
  skills: ["ct-cleo", "ct-orchestrator"]

  permissions:
    tasks: read, write
    session: read, write
    memory: read

  context:
    active-tasks
    recent-decisions

  on SessionStart:
    /checkin @all
    session "Review current sprint state"
      context: [active-tasks, recent-decisions]
```

**Agent properties**: `model`, `prompt`, `persist`, `skills`, `timeout`, `retry`,
`backoff`, plus custom key-value pairs.

**Permissions**: Domain-scoped access control. Values: `read`, `write`, `execute`.

**Inline hooks**: `on Event:` blocks inside an agent apply only to that agent.

#### Skill Definition

```cant
---
kind: skill
version: 1
---

skill ct-deploy(target: string, env: string = "staging"):
  description: "Deployment automation skill"
  tier: core
  provider: claude-code
```

Skills accept typed parameters with optional defaults.
Types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `duration`, `list`, `any`.

#### Hook Definition

```cant
---
kind: hook
version: 1
---

on SessionStart:
  /checkin @all
  session "Review current sprint state"
    context: [active-tasks, recent-decisions]

on PostToolUse:
  let result = tool.exitCode
  if result != 0:
    /info @all "Tool execution failed"
```

Hook events MUST be one of the 16 CAAMP canonical events:

`SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `PromptSubmit`, `ResponseComplete`,
`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `PermissionRequest`,
`SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `PreModel`, `PostModel`,
`PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `Notification`, `ConfigChange`

#### Import Statement

```cant
@import "./agents/security-scanner.cant"
@import scanner from "./agents/security-scanner.cant"
@import "@ct-cleo"
```

Imports bring definitions from other `.cant` files into scope. Named imports
(`scanner from "path"`) bind a specific export to a local name.

#### Let Binding

```cant
let status = task.status
let message = "Deploy ${service.name} to ${env}"
```

Binds a name to an expression value in the current scope.

### Layer 3: Orchestration DSL

Defines **how work FLOWS** -- workflows, pipelines, sessions, parallel execution,
control flow, discretion, and approval gates.

#### Workflow

Workflows MAY contain LLM-dependent constructs (sessions, discretion conditions,
approval gates).

```cant
---
kind: workflow
version: 1
---

workflow review(pr_url):
  # Deterministic pipeline first (no LLM)
  pipeline checks:
    step fetch:
      command: "gh"
      args: ["pr", "diff", pr_url]
      timeout: 30s

    step lint:
      command: "biome"
      args: ["check", "--json"]
      stdin: fetch
      timeout: 60s

  # Parallel LLM review
  parallel:
    security = session "Run security analysis"
      context: checks
    style = session "Review code style"
      context: checks

  # AI-evaluated conditional
  if **all reviews pass with no critical issues**:
    /done T{pr.task_id} #shipped
    output verdict = "approve"
  else:
    /action @author "Address review feedback"
    output verdict = "changes-requested"
```

#### Pipeline (Deterministic)

Pipelines MUST be deterministic -- **no sessions, no discretion, no approval gates,
no LLM calls**. The validator enforces this (rules P01-P07).

```cant
---
kind: pipeline
version: 1
---

pipeline deploy(service: string, env: string):
  step build:
    command: "pnpm"
    args: ["run", "build"]
    timeout: 120s

  step test:
    command: "pnpm"
    args: ["run", "test", "--reporter=json"]
    timeout: 300s

  step publish:
    command: "pnpm"
    args: ["publish", "--tag", env]
    condition: test.exitCode == 0
    timeout: 60s
```

**Step properties**: `command` (required, binary name), `args` (array), `stdin`
(prior step name), `timeout`, `condition`.

The `command` property MUST name a binary. Arguments MUST go in `args`, never via
shell interpolation in the command string (rule P06).

#### Session

Sessions are the **only place prose enters** a workflow. Two invocation forms:

```cant
# Direct prompt
session "Analyze the code for security issues"
  context: [checks, prior-reviews]

# Agent reference
session: scanner
  context: [checks]
```

#### Parallel Block

```cant
parallel:
  security = session "Run security analysis"
  style = session: quick-check
    context: checks
  depth = session: reviewer
    context: checks
```

Join strategies (optional modifier after `parallel`):

| Modifier | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| *(none)* | Wait for all arms to complete (default) |
| `race` | Return on first arm completion |
| `settle` | Wait for all, collect successes and failures |

Arm names must be unique within the block (rule S07).

#### Conditional

Conditions can be regular expressions or **discretion conditions** (AI-evaluated):

```cant
# Expression-based condition
if status == "ready":
  /done T1234

# Discretion condition (AI evaluates the prose)
if **all reviews pass with no critical issues**:
  /done T1234 #shipped
elif **security issues found**:
  /blocked T1234 #security
else:
  /action @author "Address review feedback"
```

Discretion conditions use `**prose text**` syntax. The prose is opaque to the parser --
it is passed to an LLM evaluator at runtime. Discretion conditions are **forbidden in
pipelines** (rule P02).

#### Choice (AI Multi-Option Selection)

Unlike `if/elif` which evaluates serial boolean conditions, `choice` presents N named
options to the AI evaluator and lets it select the best one:

```cant
choice **which deployment strategy best fits the risk profile**:
  option "blue-green":
    session "Execute blue-green deploy"
  option "canary":
    session "Execute canary deploy"
  option "rolling":
    session "Execute rolling deploy"
```

At least 2 options required (rule W12). Forbidden in pipelines (rule P02).

#### Loops

```cant
# Fixed count
repeat 3:
  session "Retry the operation"

# Collection iteration
for item in tasks:
  session "Process ${item}"

# Condition-based (with discretion)
loop:
  session "Check deployment status"
  until **deployment healthy for 5 minutes**
```

#### Try / Catch / Finally

```cant
try:
  session "Deploy to production"
catch err:
  /info @ops "Deployment failed: ${err}"
finally:
  /done T1234
```

The try body MUST contain at least one statement (rule W05).

#### Throw

Explicitly signal an error from workflow logic. Caught by enclosing `try/catch` blocks,
or halts the workflow if uncaught. Forbidden in pipelines (rule P08).

```cant
if status == "critical":
  throw "Deployment blocked: critical status detected"
```

#### Reusable Block

CANT's equivalent of a function/macro. Define once, call by name. Blocks inherit the
caller's scope. They MUST NOT contain `output` bindings (rule W13).

```cant
block notify(target, message):
  /info @{target} "{message}"
  session "Log notification to audit trail"

workflow deploy:
  notify(@ops-lead, "Starting deployment")
  session "Execute deployment"
  notify(@ops-lead, "Deployment complete")
```

#### Approval Gate

Human-in-the-loop approval that suspends workflow execution:

```cant
approve:
  message: "Ready to deploy to production?"
  timeout: 24h
```

The `message` property is required (rule W01). Default expiration is 24h.

#### Output Binding

```cant
output verdict = "approve"
output report = security.findings
```

Outputs are the return values of a workflow, accessible by the caller.

---

## Expression Language

The expression language is intentionally minimal. No function definitions, no closures,
no arithmetic operators.

```cant
# Variables and property access
agent.name
checks.lint.exitCode

# Comparisons
task.status == "done"
count > 0

# Boolean logic
task.done and not task.blocked
a == 1 or b == 2

# String interpolation (double-quoted only)
"Deploy ${service.name} to ${env}"

# Arrays and objects
["ct-cleo", "ct-orchestrator"]
{name: "ops-lead", model: "opus"}

# Task refs and addresses as values
T1234
@ops-lead

# Durations
30s
5m
24h
7d
```

Interpolation is **single-pass** (rule T07): if `service.name` evaluates to `"${evil}"`,
the result is literally `"${evil}"`. Use `\$` to escape a literal `${`.

## Where Prose Appears (and Where It Doesn't)

| Construct | Prose? | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Session prompts | Yes | Instruction to the LLM |
| Discretion conditions (`**...**`) | Yes | AI-evaluated logic |
| Agent definitions | **No** | Structured properties |
| Control flow (`parallel`, `if`, `loop`) | **No** | Keywords |
| References (`T1234`, `@agent`, `#tag`) | **No** | Semantic tokens |
| Pipelines | **No** | Deterministic, no LLM |
| Context wiring | **No** | Explicit `context:` declarations |

## Scope: What CANT Absorbs vs What Stays Separate

| Concept | CANT Absorbs | Stays Separate |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Agent instructions | Yes — `agent` blocks | |
| Workflow orchestration | Yes — `workflow` construct | |
| Deterministic pipelines | Yes — `pipeline` construct | |
| Skill definitions | Yes — `skill` blocks | |
| Hook configurations | Yes — `on Event:` blocks | |
| Message protocol | Yes — directive syntax | |
| LAFS response envelopes | | `lafs-core` (response format, not instruction) |
| Conduit transport | | `conduit-core` (wire protocol, not content) |
| Task state / LOOM lifecycle | | CLEO core (state machine, not instruction) |
| Config files | | JSON config (not instruction-level) |

---

## LSP Architecture

`cant-lsp` (Rust binary, built from `cant-core`) provides full editor integration:

| Feature | Source |
|---------|--------|
| **Diagnostics** | 45 validation rules: syntax errors, unknown events, missing references, pipeline purity, unused bindings, type mismatches |
| **Completions** | Keywords, canonical events (provider + domain), agent/skill/block names, properties, import paths |
| **Hover** | Directive docs, agent property descriptions, event descriptions, reference resolution (T1234 → task title) |
| **Go-to-definition** | Agent name → agent block, block name → block def, import → source file, variable → binding site |
| **Document symbols** | Outline of agents, skills, hooks, workflows, pipelines, blocks |
| **Code actions** | Auto-fix from validation diagnostics, "Extract to block", "Convert to pipeline" |
| **Formatting** | Canonical CANT style (consistent 2-space indent, property ordering) |

Editor support: VS Code extension (`editors/vscode-cant/`), Neovim (LSP client config), in-browser (napi-rs WASM).

## Design Decisions

### Why `.cant` only (no `.cant.agent`, `.cant.workflow`)?

The vision doc originally proposed compound extensions. The spec settled on universal `.cant`
with `kind:` frontmatter because:

1. **One grammar, one parser** — compound extensions imply different grammars per extension, but CANT is explicitly one grammar. The `kind:` field controls validation rules, not parsing.
2. **Simpler tooling** — editor associations, glob patterns, and build tools all work with `*.cant` instead of needing `*.cant.*` patterns.
3. **Frontmatter is more explicit** — `kind: agent` is unambiguous; filename-based inference can be wrong after refactoring.
4. **Mixed-layer documents** — a workflow file often defines inline agents. Compound extensions would force artificial file splits.

### Why non-prose?

CANT's core philosophy: prose only appears in two places (session prompts and discretion
conditions). Everything else is structured, parseable, lintable:

- **Sharper attention** — no syntactic sugar, every token carries meaning
- **Programmatic scalability** — structured templates, not generated paragraphs
- **Pattern priming** — structured input → structured output from LLMs
- **Static analysis** — an LSP validates `.cant` before any LLM touches it

### Why domain events extend CAAMP (not a separate system)?

- Single `on Event:` syntax in CANT — no namespace splitting
- Categories cleanly separate: `tool` = provider, `task` = domain
- HookRegistry already dispatches by event name, agnostic of source
- Middleware pipeline can emit domain events after CQRS mutations
- Adding events is additive — no breaking changes to existing 16 provider events
