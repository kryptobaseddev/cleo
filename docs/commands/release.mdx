# cleo release

Manage release lifecycle for roadmap and changelog integration.

<Info>**Agent Relevance**: Medium - Used for release management</Info>

## Synopsis

```bash
cleo release <subcommand> [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

The `release` command manages the complete release lifecycle from planning to shipping, including task assignment, version bumping, git tagging, and changelog generation.

<Note>
**Changelog Integration**: As of v0.74.0, `cleo release ship` **automatically generates and appends** changelog entries to `CHANGELOG.md`. The changelog is generated from release tasks and validated before the release is marked as shipped.

```
planned → active → released
```

## Changelog Integration

### Automatic Changelog Generation

Starting in v0.74.0, `cleo release ship` automatically:

1. **Discovers tasks** associated with the release (via labels or explicit assignment)
2. **Populates** `release.tasks[]` array in todo.json
3. **Generates** changelog from task data (title, description, labels)
4. **Validates** changelog is not empty
5. **Appends** to CHANGELOG.md in Keep a Changelog format
6. **Updates** release status to `released`

### Task Discovery

Tasks are included in a release if they meet **any** of these criteria:

- Explicitly assigned via `cleo release plan --tasks T001,T002`
- Have a label matching the version (e.g., `v0.65.0` or `0.65.0`)
- Have the `changelog` or `release` label AND completed between release dates
- Are completed between previous release date and current release date

### Skipping Changelog Generation

Use `--skip-changelog` to bypass automatic changelog generation:

```bash
cleo release ship v0.65.0 --skip-changelog
```

<Warning>
**Use Case**: Only skip changelog when:
- Generating changelog manually via `cleo release changelog`
- Release has no user-facing changes
- Testing release workflow
</Warning>

### Validation Gates

The `ship` command validates:

1. ✓ Release exists and is not already shipped
2. ✓ At least one task is associated with the release
3. ✓ Generated changelog is not empty (unless `--skip-changelog`)
4. ✓ CHANGELOG.md is writable
5. ✓ VERSION file matches (if `--bump-version`)

## Examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash Create Release
cleo release create v0.65.0 --target-date 2026-02-01
```

```bash Plan Tasks
cleo release plan v0.65.0 --tasks T2058,T2059
```

```bash Ship with Automatic Changelog
# Recommended: Let the system discover and generate changelog
cleo release ship v0.65.0 --bump-version --create-tag --push
```

```bash Ship without Changelog
# Skip changelog for minor releases
cleo release ship v0.65.0 --skip-changelog
```

```bash Ship with Manual Changelog
# Generate changelog separately first
cleo release changelog v0.65.0 --write-changelog
cleo release ship v0.65.0 --skip-changelog
```

```bash Ship with Notes
cleo release ship v0.65.0 --notes "Schema 2.8.0 release"
```

```bash List Releases
cleo release list
```

```bash Show Release Details
cleo release show v0.65.0
```

```bash Generate Changelog Only
# Preview or generate without shipping
cleo release changelog v0.65.0
```

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Recoverable |
|------|---------|:-----------:|
| `0` | Success | No |
| `2` | Invalid arguments | No |
| `4` | Resource not found | No |
| `6` | Validation failed | No |

## Troubleshooting

### "No tasks found for release"

**Cause**: Release has no associated tasks.

**Fix**: Add tasks via `cleo release plan --tasks T001,T002` or ensure tasks have correct labels.

### "Generated changelog is empty"

**Cause**: Tasks don't have sufficient metadata (title/description).

**Fix**: Update task descriptions or use `--skip-changelog` to bypass validation.

### "Release already shipped"

**Cause**: Release already has a `releasedAt` timestamp.

**Fix**: Verify with `cleo release show <version>`. Use `cleo release create` for new version.
