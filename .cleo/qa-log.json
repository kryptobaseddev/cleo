      "question": "How does cleo issue interact with GitHub issue templates? Does the CLI bypass the template form or does it map to the same fields?",
      "answer": "The CLI bypasses GitHub issue template forms entirely. It uses `gh issue create --title --body --label` directly (not `--template`). The CLI manually mirrors some template section headers (e.g., '### What happened?') for visual consistency but does not read or parse the YAML template files. Many template form fields (steps to reproduce, expected behavior, proposed solution, etc.) are omitted from CLI-generated issues. The two systems serve different audiences: templates are for humans via GitHub web UI with form validation; the CLI is for programmatic/agent filing via the API.",
