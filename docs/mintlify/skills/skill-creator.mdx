# Skill Creator

The Skill Creator skill provides guidance for creating effective skills that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Skill ID** | ct-skill-creator |
| **Tier** | 3 (Support) |
| **Protocol** | implementation |
| **Tags** | skills, creation, meta |

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. They transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge.

### What Skills Provide

1. **Specialized workflows** - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. **Tool integrations** - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. **Domain expertise** - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. **Bundled resources** - Scripts, references, and assets for complex tasks

## Core Principles

### Concise is Key

The context window is shared with everything else Claude needs. Only add context Claude doesn't already have.

**Default assumption**: Claude is already very smart.

### Degrees of Freedom

Match specificity to task fragility:

| Freedom | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| **High** (text instructions) | Multiple approaches valid, heuristics guide |
| **Medium** (pseudocode) | Preferred pattern exists, some variation ok |
| **Low** (specific scripts) | Fragile operations, consistency critical |

## Skill Anatomy

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description)
│   └── Markdown instructions
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code
    ├── references/       - Documentation
    └── assets/           - Files for output
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: What this skill does and when to use it.
Include triggering contexts here.
version: 1.0.0
---

# Skill Name

Instructions for using this skill...
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `name` | Yes | Skill identifier |
| `description` | Yes | Triggering mechanism - describes when to use |
| `version` | No | Semantic version |

<Warning>
The `description` field is the PRIMARY triggering mechanism. Include all "when to use" information here, not in the body.
</Warning>

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited)

### Pattern: High-level with References

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start

[basic example]

## Advanced features

- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md)
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)
```

## Creation Process

### Step 1: Understand with Examples

Gather concrete examples of how the skill will be used.

### Step 2: Plan Reusable Contents

Identify scripts, references, and assets needed.

### Step 3: Initialize

```bash
scripts/init_skill.py skill-name --path skills/
```

### Step 4: Implement

Create resources and write SKILL.md.

### Step 5: Test

Invoke with trigger phrases and verify output.

### Step 6: Iterate

Improve based on real usage.

## What NOT to Include

Do NOT create:
- README.md
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- User-facing documentation

Skills are for AI agents, not humans.
