# analyze Command

Smart task triage and prioritization using leverage scoring, bottleneck detection, and domain grouping.

## Usage

```bash
claude-todo analyze [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

The `analyze` command provides intelligent task prioritization by calculating leverage scores, identifying bottlenecks, grouping tasks by domain, and recommending an optimal action order. It combines multiple analysis dimensions to help LLM agents and users make data-driven decisions about what to work on next.

**Default output is LLM-optimized JSON** designed for autonomous agent consumption. Use `--human` for human-readable text output.

This command is particularly useful for:
- **LLM agents**: Token-efficient structured JSON with all analysis data for autonomous task selection
- **Decision paralysis**: Data-driven task prioritization when multiple options exist
- **Project planning**: Understanding dependency chains and bottlenecks
- **Impact assessment**: Identifying which tasks unlock the most downstream work

## Algorithm

### 1. Leverage Score Calculation

Leverage measures downstream impact - how many tasks become unblocked if this task completes:

```
leverage_score = (unlocks_count * 15) + priority_score
```

**Components**:
- **Priority Score**: Task's intrinsic priority (critical=100, high=75, medium=50, low=25)
- **Unlocks Count**: Number of tasks directly blocked by this task

**Example**:
```
Task T312 (high priority) blocks 11 tasks
Leverage Score = (11 * 15) + 75 = 240
```

### 2. Actionable vs Blocked Detection

Tasks are classified as **actionable** if all their dependencies are satisfied (status=done).

```json
{
  "is_actionable": true,   // All deps completed
  "blocked_by": []         // Empty - no blockers
}
```

Blocked tasks have unsatisfied dependencies:
```json
{
  "is_actionable": false,
  "blocked_by": ["T312", "T204"]  // Waiting on these
}
```

### 3. Bottleneck Detection

Bottlenecks are tasks that block 2+ other tasks:

```bash
T312 blocks: T316, T317, T318... (11 total) -> CRITICAL BOTTLENECK
T204 blocks: T215, T216, T217... (7 total)  -> HIGH BOTTLENECK
```

### 4. Tier Assignment

Tasks are automatically grouped into action tiers based on leverage and actionability:

| Tier | Criteria | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Tier 1: Unblock** | Actionable AND unlocks 3+ tasks | Start immediately |
| **Tier 2: Critical** | Actionable AND (critical OR high priority) | Prioritize next |
| **Tier 3: Blocked** | Has unsatisfied dependencies | Wait for blockers |
| **Tier 4: Routine** | Actionable AND (medium OR low priority) | Normal queue |

### 5. Domain Grouping

Tasks are dynamically grouped by their labels to identify thematic clusters:

```json
{
  "domains": [
    {"domain": "feature-phase", "count": 12, "actionable_count": 8},
    {"domain": "hierarchy", "count": 22, "actionable_count": 1},
    {"domain": "testing", "count": 10, "actionable_count": 3}
  ]
}
```

## Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--human` | | Human-readable text output | (JSON) |
| `--full` | | Comprehensive human-readable report | (JSON) |
| `--auto-focus` | | Automatically set focus to top recommendation | `false` |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message | |

```

### Full Format (`--full`)

Comprehensive human-readable report with detailed tier breakdowns:

```bash
claude-todo analyze --full
```

Includes everything from `--human` plus:
- Detailed task lists for each tier
- Which tasks each bottleneck unblocks
- Which dependencies are blocking each blocked task
- Full domain breakdown with task IDs

## Use Cases

### 1. Autonomous Agent Task Selection

```bash
# LLM agent gets full analysis, selects optimal task
analysis=$(claude-todo analyze)
task_id=$(echo "$analysis" | jq -r '.recommendation.task_id')
claude-todo focus set "$task_id"
```

### 2. Autonomous Mode with Auto-Focus

```bash
# Analyze and automatically set focus to top recommendation
claude-todo analyze --auto-focus
```

### 3. Human Planning Session

```bash
# Get readable overview for sprint planning
claude-todo analyze --human

# Get detailed breakdown for deeper analysis
claude-todo analyze --full
```

### 4. CI/CD Health Check

```bash
# Check for bottleneck health in pipeline
analysis=$(claude-todo analyze)
bottleneck_count=$(echo "$analysis" | jq '.summary.bottleneck_count')
blocked_ratio=$(echo "$analysis" | jq '.summary.blocked / .summary.total_pending')

if (( $(echo "$blocked_ratio > 0.8" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "WARNING: 80%+ tasks blocked - resolve bottlenecks"
fi
```

### 5. Extract Top Action Order

```bash
# Get just the action order for quick decisions
claude-todo analyze | jq -r '.action_order[0:5][] | "\(.id) - \(.reason)"'
```

## Understanding the Output

### Leverage Score

Higher leverage = higher impact. Work on high-leverage tasks first:

| Score Range | Impact | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **200+** | Critical | Immediate attention |
| **100-199** | High | Next in queue |
| **50-99** | Medium | Standard priority |
| **<50** | Low | Background/defer |

### Actionable vs Blocked

- **Actionable tasks**: Ready to work on (all dependencies satisfied)
- **Blocked tasks**: Waiting on other tasks (shown in Tier 3)

Only Tier 1 and Tier 2 contain actionable tasks. Tier 3 explicitly shows what's blocking each task.

### Domain Insights

Domains are grouped by labels. Use this to:
- Identify which feature areas have work available
- See bottleneck concentration by domain
- Plan sprints around domain themes

## Comparison with Other Commands
