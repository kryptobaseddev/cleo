## Why CLEO?

  <Accordion title="Anti-Hallucination Validation">
    Every operation is validated against JSON Schema before execution. Tasks must have unique IDs, valid statuses, and proper timestamps.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Context Persistence">
    State persists across Claude conversations. Resume where you left off with `cleo session resume`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="LLM-First Output">
    JSON by default when piped. Structured error responses with copy-paste fix commands.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Agent Support">
