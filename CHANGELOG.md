## [0.74.5] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **`--human` Flag Not Working on Multiple Commands**:
  - Root cause: `flags.sh` standardized `--human` → `FLAG_FORMAT="human"`, but most scripts' case statements only matched `json` and `text`
  - `--human` was falling through to JSON output instead of human-readable text
  - Fix: `resolve_format()` in `lib/output-format.sh` now normalizes `"human"` → `"text"` for backward compatibility
  - Affected commands: commands, next, history, dash, labels, stats, blockers, deps, and 50+ others
  - All commands using `resolve_format()` now correctly handle `--human`

## [0.74.4] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **Bash 4+ Detection in CLI Wrapper** (GitHub #12, related to #10):

  - Ensures global agent files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, etc.) always have correct injection

## [0.74.2] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- **Progressive Disclosure Error Output** (T2521, T2586-T2589):
  - Error responses now use smart progressive disclosure (63% reduction: 14K → 5K chars)
  - Smart summaries preserve decision-relevant fields for agent decision-making:
    - Sessions: id, name, scope, focus (enough to choose the right session)
    - Epics: id, title (truncated), status, pending count (enough to pick work)
  - Unknown arrays get count-only treatment for maximum reduction
  - `CLEO_VERBOSE=1` environment variable enables full verbose context for debugging
  - New `minimize_error_context()` with domain-aware summarization
  - New `is_verbose_mode()` function for detecting debug mode

### Documentation

## [0.72.1] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **Bash 5.3+ brace expansion bug**: Fixed jq parse errors ("Unmatched '}' at line 1, column 3") when ending sessions

## [0.63.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Orchestrator Compliance & Metrics System**:
  - `lib/compliance-check.sh` - Subagent compliance validation (manifest, links, return format)
  - `lib/metrics-aggregation.sh` - Project compliance summary aggregation
  - `lib/metrics-enums.sh` - Strict enum definitions for metrics fields

  - Useful for permanent tracking epics or tasks requiring explicit manual completion
  - `--no-auto-complete` flag added to `update-task.sh`
- **Doctor Progress Indicators** (T1998):
  - Shows "Checking CLEO installation...", "Validating project X/Y..." during execution
  - Only displays for human format when stdout is TTY
  - Progress writes to stderr, results to stdout
- **Command Documentation**:
  - `docs/commands/extract.md` - Data export documentation

### Changed
- **Doctor command now shows ALL projects** (T1997):
  - Previously only showed projects with warnings/failures
  - Now shows healthy projects with ✓ checkmark and "-" for issues
  - All registered projects visible in table regardless of status

### Fixed
- **Doctor --fix now auto-upgrades projects with outdated schemas**:
  - Previously only printed a note to run `cleo upgrade` manually
  - Now automatically runs `cleo upgrade --force` in each affected project
  - Shows progress: "Upgrading: project-name..." with success/failure indicators
- **Doctor schema version mismatch** (T1988):
  - Doctor now reads actual project file versions instead of stale registry cache

  - Added `--quiet --human` flags for fastest validation path
  - Fixed orphaned vs temp project double-counting logic
- **VERSION parsing with multi-line files**: Fixed version string concatenation when VERSION files contain metadata lines (mode=, source=, installed=). All version consumers now use `head -n 1` to read only the semver line.
- Multi-session isolation now works correctly with hybrid binding architecture (T1356)
- Session resolution uses 4-priority cascade: --session flag, CLEO_SESSION env, TTY binding, .current-session
- Per-session context state files now written correctly

## [0.62.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **Doctor command enhancements**:
  - New `lib/doctor-project-cache.sh` for validation result caching with 5-minute TTL
  - Color-coded status indicators for improved visual feedback in project health reports
  - Actionable guidance with specific remediation commands for detected issues
  - Performance optimization: skip validation for temporary/orphaned projects

  - Fixed color variable scoping - colors now properly exported for helper functions
  - Fixed project table filter logic - changed from OR to AND logic for accurate issue reporting
- **Migration system bug**: Fixed hardcoded schema versions in `migrate_config_to_2_5_0()` - now uses `get_schema_version_from_file()` for dynamic version reads

- **Bash 4+ auto-detection on macOS**: Installer detects system Bash < 4 and automatically re-executes with Homebrew Bash if available at `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash` or `/usr/local/bin/bash`

### Fixed
- **Mintlify MDX parsing errors**: Converted HTML comments (`<!-- -->`) to JSX comments (`{/* */}`) in all 53 command documentation files
- **MDX frontmatter placement**: Comments now placed AFTER frontmatter closing `---` as required by MDX spec
- **Generator script**: `dev/generate-command-docs.sh` now outputs JSX comments for future regenerations

## [0.60.1] - 2026-01-21

### Added

  - Exit codes: 0 (updated), 102 (no changes needed), 1 (failed)
  - Useful alternative to full `upgrade` when only agent docs need updating

### Fixed
- **Agent docs not created on existing projects**: `injection_check_all()` was silently skipping missing files due to `if [[ -f "$target" ]]` guard
  - Now reports ALL targets including missing ones with status "missing"
  - Enables `upgrade` to properly detect and create missing CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/GEMINI.md
- **Block content validation**: `injection_check()` now validates block content matches expected `@.cleo/templates/AGENT-INJECTION.md` reference
  - Returns "outdated" status if content doesn't match, triggering update
  - Previously returned "current" for any existing block without content validation

### Changed
- `upgrade` now properly handles all agent doc scenarios:
  - Missing files → Creates them
  - Outdated content → Updates them
  - No block present → Prepends block
  - Current → Skips (no change)

## [0.60.0] - 2026-01-20

### Added

### Validated
- ORC-001 through ORC-005 constraints verified with real subagent spawning
  - ORC-001: Orchestrator stays high-level (no direct implementation)
  - ORC-002: All work delegated via Task tool
  - ORC-003: Manifest summaries only (no full file reads)
  - ORC-004: Sequential wave execution (dependency order)
  - ORC-005: Context budget maintained via manifest-based handoff

## [0.58.7] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Injection Markers**: Remove version tracking from CLEO markers
  - Markers now versionless: `<!-- CLEO:START -->` (no version number)
  - Since markers use `@-references` to external files, version was meaningless
  - Block presence = configured (no version comparison needed)
  - Prevents unnecessary repeated updates and potential duplication
  - Legacy versioned markers still recognized for backward compatibility
  - Simplified `injection_check()` to verify block existence only
  - Updated `setup-agents.sh`, installer, `session.sh`, `doctor.sh`

  - Root cause: jq's `//` operator treats `false` as falsy (`false // true` = `true`)
  - When user set `multiSession.enabled: false`, system still behaved as if enabled
  - Result: Chicken-and-egg problem - couldn't create epic without session, couldn't start session without epic
  - Fix: Changed `// true` default to explicit null check: `if .multiSession.enabled == null then true else .multiSession.enabled end`
  - Fixed in: `lib/sessions.sh` (is_multi_session_enabled), `lib/session-enforcement.sh` (is_session_enforcement_enabled)

- **session start --help threw error** - Added --help flag handling to cmd_start()
  - Previously: `--help` was swallowed by `*) shift ;;` catch-all, triggering multi-session discovery mode
  - Now: `--help` is handled before any session logic, correctly shows usage

### Technical Details
- `lib/sessions.sh:118`: Changed `jq -r '.multiSession.enabled // true'` to explicit null check
- `lib/session-enforcement.sh:93`: Same fix for session enforcement check
- `scripts/session.sh:347`: Added `-h|--help) usage; exit 0 ;;` to cmd_start() argument parser

## [0.41.9] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Parallel agent active task constraint** - Fixed `update --status active` blocking parallel agents
  - When `session.allowParallelAgents: true`, active task constraint is now skipped entirely
  - When `multiSession.enabled: true`, constraint checks within session scope only (not global)
  - Previously: Global "one active task" check blocked all parallel agent work
  - Now: Multiple subagents can activate their assigned tasks simultaneously
  - Per MULTI-SESSION-SPEC Part 4: One active task per scope, not global

- **Test fixture session enforcement** - Added explicit multiSession/session config to test fixtures
  - Test config now sets `multiSession.enabled: false` and `session.requireSession: false`
  - Prevents test failures from strict session enforcement in test environment

### Technical Details
- `scripts/update-task.sh` lines 889-932: Refactored active task constraint
  - Checks `session.allowParallelAgents` first (skip if true)
  - Falls back to scope-aware check if multiSession enabled
  - Uses `get_active_session_info()` from session-enforcement.sh for scope resolution
- `tests/test_helper/common_setup.bash` lines 97-103: Added multiSession/session config

## [0.41.8] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- **Chain visualization connected components** - Fixed BFS traversal in `analyze --parent --human`
  - Inventory categories (completed, ready, blocked) now preserve original `.depends` arrays
  - Chain computation uses full dependency graph instead of empty arrays for non-blocked tasks
  - Before: Every task shown as isolated chain (26 single-task chains)
  - After: Properly connected chains (e.g., 5 chains showing task relationships)
  - Added `depends` field to inventory output for completed, ready, and blocked tasks
  - Per CHAIN-VISUALIZATION-SPEC Part 3: Chain Detection Algorithm

### Technical Details
- `scripts/analyze.sh` lines 366-400: Added `depends: (.depends // [])` to all inventory templates
- `scripts/analyze.sh` lines 802-804: Changed chain computation to use `.depends` instead of `[]`

## [0.41.7] - 2025-12-29

### Changed
- **hierarchy.maxSiblings now defaults to 0 (unlimited)** - LLM-Agent-First design update
  - Schema default: `maxSiblings: 0` (was 20, originally 7)
  - LLM agents don't need cognitive limits; limits only create friction
  - `countDoneInLimit: false` still excludes completed tasks by default
  - `maxActiveSiblings: 8` still available for optional context management

### Fixed
- **Library sourcing order in scripts** - Fixed potential config initialization issues
  - `config.sh` now sourced BEFORE `hierarchy.sh` in all affected scripts
  - Ensures config functions available when hierarchy functions initialize
  - Fixed in: `add-task.sh`, `update-task.sh`, `reopen.sh`, `focus.sh`, `uncancel.sh`

### Documentation
- Updated 14 documentation files to reflect unlimited siblings default
  - Removed all references to "max 7 siblings" constraint

  - Can auto-fix with `--fix` flag

### Fixed
- **Injection tag consistency** - All injection markers now use `CLEO:START`/`CLEO:END` exclusively
  - No more legacy `CLAUDE-TODO:START` detection or migration code

## [0.41.3] - 2025-12-29

### Changed
- **Compact JSON output by default** - All JSON output now uses compact format (single line)
  - LLM agents benefit from compact output: prevents truncation issues like "+N lines"
  - All `jq -n` calls changed to `jq -nc` across all scripts and libraries
  - Human users can pipe through `| jq .` for pretty-printed output if needed
  - Aligned with LLM-Agent-First design principle

### Fixed
- **Test assertions for compact JSON** - Updated tests expecting pretty-printed JSON
  - `'"success": true'` → `'"success":true'` (no space after colon in compact JSON)
  - Affected tests: session show JSON structure, dry run assertions

## [0.41.2] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **Session lock deadlock** - Fixed double-locking issue in `suspend_session`, `close_session`, and `end_session`
  - These functions now use `aw_atomic_write` directly instead of `save_json` when locks are already held
  - Resolves "Failed to acquire lock" errors during session lifecycle operations

- **Auto-focus priority selection** (T973) - Fixed `auto_select_focus_task()` to exclude epic-type tasks

- **Dry-run for session start** (T980) - Fixed `--dry-run` flag parsing in `cmd_start_multi_session`
  - All global flags (--dry-run, --format, --json, --human, --quiet) now parsed after subcommand

- **Dry-run for session suspend** (T981) - Added `--dry-run` flag parsing to `cmd_suspend`
  - Suspend dry-run now shows preview without modifying state

### Added
- **Context-aware output** (T969) - Added session context to `show`, `list`, and `analyze` commands
  - When session is active, output includes session ID, focus info, and available actions
  - JSON output includes `_meta.session` field with session context
  - Text output shows "Session Context" section with session details

## [0.41.1] - 2025-12-29

  - Enable Epic-Bound Sessions with `multiSession.enabled: true` in config

## [0.40.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- **Actionable Error System (LLM-Agent-First)** - Errors now include executable recovery commands

## [0.39.2] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Cancelled task handling overhaul** (T952) - Complete fix for cancelled task lifecycle

  - JSON output: `.tree[0]` contains the root task with nested `.children` arrays
  - Human output: Proper ASCII tree with Unicode/ASCII connectors (├──, └──, │)
  - Tasks array (`.tasks[]`) is filtered to match tree content
  - All 2209 tests passing

## [0.39.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Hierarchy-aware leverage scoring** in `analyze` command
  - Dependencies now weighted by relationship type for more strategic prioritization
  - Parent→child dependencies: 0.3x weight (same scope, less strategic impact)
  - Cross-epic dependencies: 1.0x weight (standard true blockers)
  - Cross-phase dependencies: 1.5x weight (phase alignment = higher strategic value)
  - New `weighted_unlocks` field in leverage data shows weighted sum

- Tier 1 tasks sorted by weighted unlocks for better prioritization

## [0.38.2] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed
- **Legacy .project format compatibility** - Extended type guards to all scripts accessing `.project`
  - Fixed 60 occurrences across 8 scripts where `.project.phases` or `.project.currentPhase`
    could fail when `.project` is a string (pre-v2.2.0 legacy format) instead of an object
  - Scripts fixed: phase.sh (30), validate.sh (14), add-task.sh (5), inject-todowrite.sh (3),
    update-task.sh (2), next.sh (2), focus.sh (2), extract-todowrite.sh (1)
  - Pattern: `(if (.project | type) == "object" then .project.X else null end) // fallback`
  - All 2198 tests passing

## [0.38.1] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed
- **claude-migrate arithmetic bug** - Fixed `((files_moved++))` causing exit with `set -e`
  - Added `|| true` to prevent exit code 1 when incrementing from 0
  - Empty `.claude/` directory now removed after successful migration
  - Tests updated to match new behavior (non-CLEO files preserved in .claude/)

- **Schema migration detection** - Fixed incorrect status code handling in `scripts/migrate.sh`
  - Status code 3 (major version upgrade like 0.x → 2.x) was falling through to unknown/no-migration
  - Now properly requires `--force` flag for major version upgrades
  - Added status code 4 for "data newer than schema" (cannot migrate, upgrade cleo instead)
  - `cleo migrate status` now shows correct migration needs for all version differences

- **Project migration preserves .claude/** - `cleo claude-migrate --project` no longer removes `.claude/`
  - Only migrates CLEO-specific files: todo.json, todo-config.json, todo-log.json, todo-archive.json
  - Other files in `.claude/` (Claude Code settings, MCP configs, etc.) are preserved
  - JSON output includes `claudeDirPreserved: true` and `remainingInClaude` count
  - Detects if `.claude/` contains no CLEO files and reports "nothing to migrate"

- **v2.2.0 migration preserves existing phases** - `migrate_todo_to_2_2_0()` properly merges phases
  - Existing top-level `.phases` are moved into `.project.phases` (not replaced with defaults)
  - User's custom phases take precedence over template defaults
  - Removes top-level `.phases` after migration

- **Structural version detection** - `detect_file_version()` checks structure, not just version field
  - Catches cases where `.version` claims "2.4.0" but data is still pre-v2.2.0 format
  - Detects string `.project` field and top-level `.phases` as needing migration
  - Returns "2.1.0" for files needing v2.2.0 migration regardless of claimed version

- **Migration path execution** - `find_migration_path()` runs all intermediate migrations
  - For 0.2.1 → 2.4.0: runs v2.2.0, v2.3.0, v2.4.0 migrations in sequence
  - Previously jumped directly to target, skipping crucial transformations

- **phases.sh legacy format support** - Fixed jq errors when `.project` is a string
  - Added type checks before accessing `.project.phases` and `.project.currentPhase`
  - Falls back to top-level `.phases` for legacy data

### Changed
- **Migration status codes** - Improved semantic clarity in `lib/migrate.sh`
  - `check_compatibility()` now returns: 0=current, 1=patch, 2=minor, 3=major, 4=data_newer
  - Major version migrations (e.g., 0.2.1 → 2.4.0) are now allowed with `--force`
  - Data newer than schema is now clearly separated as an upgrade-cleo scenario

- **Documentation updates** - Updated AGENT-INJECTION.md and TODO_Task_Management.md
  - Added `populate-hierarchy` command to hierarchy section
  - Updated version marker to v0.38.0

## [0.38.0] - 2025-12-27
