# Introduction to CLEO

CLEO (Command Line Entity Orchestrator) is a **task management system designed specifically for AI coding agents** and solo developers. It provides enterprise-grade reliability with a focus on preventing AI-generated errors from corrupting your workflow data.

    Every operation is validated before execution with multi-layer checks

    JSON by default for agent consumption, human-readable when needed

## Why CLEO?

Traditional task management tools weren't designed for AI-assisted development workflows. CLEO addresses three critical challenges:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI Hallucination Prevention" icon="brain">
    AI agents can generate syntactically valid but semantically incorrect data. CLEO's multi-layer validation ensures:
    - Schema validation at every write
    - Cross-file integrity checks
    - Semantic validation (no future timestamps, valid status transitions)
    - Duplicate detection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session Continuity" icon="clock">
    Development work is rarely linear. CLEO provides:
    - Complete audit trails in `todo-log.jsonl`
    - Automatic backups before every modification
    - Session management with start/end protocols
    - Focus tracking for single-task discipline
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent-First Design" icon="robot">
    Built for LLM agents from the ground up:
    - JSON output by default (detects TTY vs piped)
    - Exit codes for programmatic handling
    - Structured error messages with fix suggestions
    - Command discovery via `cleo commands`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Core Concepts

### Tasks and Hierarchy

CLEO organizes work into a three-level hierarchy:

```
Epic (large scope) → Task (unit of work) → Subtask (atomic piece)
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Creating Tasks">
    ```bash
    # Simple task
    cleo add "Fix login bug"

    # Task with hierarchy
    cleo add "Auth System" --type epic --size large
    cleo add "JWT Middleware" --parent T001 --type task
    cleo add "Token Validation" --parent T002 --type subtask
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Managing Tasks">
    ```bash
    # View tasks
    cleo list
    cleo list --tree          # Hierarchical view

    # Complete task
    cleo complete T003

    # Update with notes
    cleo update T001 --notes "Implemented base auth"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Sessions and Focus

CLEO enforces **single-task discipline** through focus management:

```bash
# Start your day
cleo session start
cleo focus set T001          # One active task at a time

# Work on task...
cleo focus note "Making progress on auth"

# End your day
cleo archive                 # Clean up completed tasks
cleo session end
```

<Note>
Sessions persist across Claude conversations. When you start a new terminal session, resume with `cleo session resume`.
</Note>

### Data Files

CLEO maintains four core data files in your project's `.cleo/` directory:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `todo.json` | Active tasks (source of truth) |
| `todo-archive.json` | Completed/archived tasks |
| `todo-log.jsonl` | Immutable audit trail |
| `config.json` | Project configuration |

## Quick Example

```bash
# Initialize CLEO in your project
cd /path/to/your/project
cleo init

# Add your first task
cleo add "Implement user authentication" \
  --priority high \
  --labels backend,security \
  --description "Add JWT-based auth with refresh tokens"

# Set focus and start working
cleo focus set T001

# Track progress
cleo update T001 --notes "Completed JWT signing implementation"

# Complete when done
cleo complete T001

# View project status
cleo dash
```
