# Docs Lookup

The Docs Lookup skill provides context injection for querying library and framework documentation using Context7.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Skill ID** | ct-docs-lookup |
| **Tier** | 3 (Support) |
| **Protocol** | research |
| **Tags** | documentation, libraries |

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user:

- Asks setup or configuration questions ("How do I configure Next.js middleware?")
- Requests code involving libraries ("Write a Prisma query for...")
- Needs API references ("What are the Supabase auth methods?")
- Mentions specific frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Express, Tailwind, etc.)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve Library ID

Call `resolve-library-id` with:
- `libraryName`: The library name from user's question
- `query`: The user's full question

### Step 2: Select Best Match

From results, choose based on:
- Exact or closest name match
- Higher benchmark scores
- Version-specific IDs if user mentioned version

### Step 3: Fetch Documentation

Call `query-docs` with:
- `libraryId`: Selected Context7 library ID (e.g., `/vercel/next.js`)
- `query`: User's specific question

### Step 4: Use Documentation

- Answer using current, accurate information
- Include relevant code examples
- Cite library version when relevant

## Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Pass full question as query
- **Version awareness**: Use version-specific IDs when mentioned ("Next.js 15", "React 19")
- **Prefer official sources**: Choose official packages over community forks

## Example

```
User: "How do I set up authentication with Next.js App Router?"

1. resolve-library-id("next.js", "set up authentication with Next.js App Router")
   → /vercel/next.js

2. query-docs("/vercel/next.js", "authentication App Router setup")
   → Current documentation with code examples

3. Provide answer with accurate, version-specific information
```

## Integration with Documentor

This skill is invoked by `ct-documentor` during the discovery phase to:
- Find existing documentation on a topic
- Reference official library docs before writing
- Verify code examples are current
