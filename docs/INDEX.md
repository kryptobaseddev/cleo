# CLEO

**A vendor-neutral Brain and Memory system for AI software development.**

CLEO provides portable project memory, verifiable provenance, and agent-safe orchestration across any repository, model provider, or coding tool.

> **One developer. One AI agent. One source of truth.**

## Four Systems

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| **[BRAIN](concepts/vision.md#brain-the-memory-system)** | Memory & Cognition — persistent observations, patterns, learnings, decisions |
| **[RCASD-IVTR+C](concepts/vision.md#rcasd-ivtrc-the-lifecycle-pipeline)** | Structured Lifecycle — 10-stage pipeline with gate enforcement |
| **[NEXUS](concepts/vision.md#nexus-the-cross-project-network)** | Cross-Project Network — federated queries, global patterns, permissions |
| **[LAFS](concepts/vision.md#lafs-the-agent-communication-contract)** | Agent Communication — JSON envelopes, MVI disclosure, exit codes |
