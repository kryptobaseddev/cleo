## Developer vs Consumer Docs

This **Developer** tab contains technical content for contributors and those building on CLEO:
- Internal architecture and implementation details
- Protocol specifications and algorithm descriptions
- Code contribution guidelines and testing requirements

For **user-facing documentation**, see:
- [Getting Started](/getting-started/index) - Installation and quickstart
- [Guides](/guides/index) - Workflow tutorials and best practices
- [Commands](/commands/index) - CLI command reference
- [Skills](/skills/index) - Using CLEO skills

## Key Concepts for Developers

### Two-Tier Architecture
CLEO uses a **two-tier subagent system**:
- **Tier 0**: Orchestrator coordinates workflows and resolves tokens
- **Tier 1**: Universal subagent executes with skill-specific protocols

### Schema-Driven Validation
All data operations use JSON Schema validation with atomic write patterns:
1. Write to temporary file
2. Validate against schema
3. Create backup
4. Atomic rename

### Protocol Stack
CLEO implements 7 canonical protocols across 3 lifecycle phases:
- **RCSD Pipeline**: Research → Consensus → Specification → Decomposition
- **Execution**: Implementation → Contribution → Release

See [Protocol Stack Spec](/specs/PROTOCOL-STACK-SPEC) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Key areas:
- **Core CLI**: Bash scripts and libraries
- **Skills**: New agent skills for specialized workflows
- **Documentation**: User guides and technical specs
- **Testing**: BATS test coverage

See [Contributing Guide](/contributing) for detailed instructions.
