# CLEO Web Dashboard - Architecture & Feature Specification

**Epic**: T4284 (CLEO Nexus Command Center WebUI)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Active Specification (web.sh lifecycle management references will be ported to TypeScript during V2 conversion)
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-14

**Companion Document**: [CLEO-WEB-DASHBOARD-UI.md](./CLEO-WEB-DASHBOARD-UI.md) -- Visual design, layouts, components

---

## 1. Vision

A local web-based Command Center that provides visual access to everything CLEO knows -- tasks, sessions, dependencies, research, compliance, releases, and cross-project intelligence. The dashboard starts as a read-only visualization layer and evolves through phases to become an interactive management interface.

### Core Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth** -- Reads the same `.cleo/` files as CLI and MCP. No separate database.
2. **No Code Duplication** -- Imports existing MCP domain handlers directly. No re-implementation.
3. **Local-First** -- Runs on localhost only. No cloud, no auth for MVP.
4. **CLI-Managed Lifecycle** -- `cleo web start|stop|status|open`. Bash manages the Node.js process.
5. **Progressive Enhancement** -- Read-only first, then interactive, then write-capable.

---

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Stack

```
Browser (localhost:3456)
    |
    | HTTP REST + WebSocket
    v
Fastify Web Server (src/web/)
    |
    | Direct import (in-process, no exec)
    v
MCP Domain Handlers (src/mcp/domains/)
    |
    | Native engine or CLI exec
    v
CLEO Data Files (~/.cleo/ + ./.cleo/)
```

The web server is part of the `@cleocode/cleo` package. It imports domain handlers directly -- same code path as MCP tool calls, but served over HTTP instead of stdio.

### 2.2 Why Inside the Package

- Domain handlers already have query/mutate for all 10 domains (123 operations)
- Native engine implementations avoid CLI exec overhead for critical paths
- Single `npm run build` produces both MCP server and web server
- Shared TypeScript types, validation, and error handling

### 2.3 Process Model

```
cleo web start [--port 3456]
    |
    v
~/.cleo/scripts/web.sh
    |
    | node dist/web/index.js --port 3456
    v
Fastify server bound to 127.0.0.1:3456
    |
    | PID -> ~/.cleo/web-server.pid
    | Config -> ~/.cleo/web-server.json
    | Log -> ~/.cleo/logs/web-server.log
```

---

## 3. Data Sources

The dashboard has access to rich structured data from CLEO's file-based storage.

### 3.1 Project-Level Data (`.cleo/`)

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Read-Only Dashboard (MVP)

**Goal**: See everything CLEO knows. No writes.

**Features**:
- Project overview with task counts, phase progress, health status
- Task list with filtering (status, priority, phase, label, search)
- Task detail view with full metadata, notes, acceptance criteria
- Task hierarchy tree (epic -> task -> subtask) with expand/collapse
- Dependency graph visualization (D3.js force-directed)
- Session list with efficiency metrics
- Release list with completion percentages
- System health panel (version, schema, storage, warnings)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket when files change
- `cleo web start|stop|status` CLI commands

**Data shown**:
- Active tasks (566), priorities, phases, labels
- Dependency graph (119 edges)
- Sessions (622), focus history
- Releases (~10), task assignments
- Project health, CLEO version

### Phase 2: Enhanced Visualization & Analytics

**Goal**: Charts, trends, and deeper data exploration.

**Features**:
- Task velocity chart (completed per day/week over time)
- Priority distribution donut chart
- Phase progress bar chart
- Epic progress cards with completion %
- Session efficiency trends (tokens per task completed)
- Compliance trend line chart
- Cycle time histogram (how long tasks take by priority/size)
- Token usage breakdown by category
- Activity timeline (audit log visualization)
- Label cloud / tag frequency
- Dependency bottleneck highlighting (highest blocking count)
- Archive explorer -- browse 4,165 completed tasks with search
- Research artifact browser with status filtering
- RCSD lifecycle pipeline visualization

### Phase 3: Interactive Management

**Goal**: Perform common task operations from the dashboard.

**Features**:
- Create tasks (title, priority, phase, parent, labels, description)
- Update task status (pending -> active -> done)
- Quick-complete tasks with one click
- Edit task priority, labels, notes
- Drag-and-drop task reordering within lists
- Set/clear session focus from task detail
- Start/end sessions from UI
- Add task notes (append-only, matches CLI behavior)
- Bulk status updates (select multiple, change status)
- Task dependency editing (add/remove deps)
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Undo for recent operations (where supported)

**Safety**: All writes go through MCP domain handler `mutate()` which enforces validation, atomic writes, and audit logging. No direct file manipulation.

### Phase 4: Advanced Intelligence

**Goal**: Cross-project views, brain exploration, automation.

**Features**:
- Multi-project Nexus view (aggregate across registered projects)
- Cross-project dependency visualization
- Global task search across all projects
- Brain/memory explorer (research, consensus, patterns)
- Decision log viewer with linked tasks
- Release planning interface (assign tasks, set dates, preview)
- Compliance dashboard with violation drill-down
- Backup management (list, restore from UI)
- Schema migration status
- Custom dashboard layouts (pin/arrange panels)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Export views as PNG/PDF

```

```bash
cleo web start              # Start server (default port 3456)
cleo web start --port 8080  # Custom port
cleo web start --open       # Start + open browser
cleo web stop               # Stop server (via PID file)
cleo web status             # Check if running, show URL
cleo web open               # Open browser to running instance
```

---

## 7. Technical Decisions

### 7.1 Frontend Approach

**Phase 1-2**: Server-rendered HTML + vanilla JS + Alpine.js for interactivity.
- No build step for client code
- Tailwind CSS via CDN or pre-built
- D3.js for graph visualization
- Chart.js for statistical charts
- Fast iteration, simple deployment

**Phase 3+**: Evaluate migration to SvelteKit or similar if complexity warrants it.

### 7.2 Data Access Pattern

Web routes call domain handlers directly:

```typescript
// routes/tasks.ts
import { TasksHandler } from '../../domains/tasks';

app.get('/api/tasks', async (req, reply) => {
  const handler = new TasksHandler(executor);
  const result = await handler.query('list', {
    status: req.query.status,
    priority: req.query.priority,
  });
  return result;
});
```

For time-series metrics (JSONL files), a dedicated `MetricsService` parses and aggregates:

```typescript
// services/metrics-service.ts
class MetricsService {
  async getSessionMetrics(since?: string): Promise<TimeSeriesData>
  async getTokenUsage(since?: string): Promise<TimeSeriesData>
  async getComplianceTrend(since?: string): Promise<TimeSeriesData>
}
```

### 7.3 File Watching Strategy

```typescript
// Watch these paths, debounce 200ms
const watchPaths = [
  '.cleo/todo.json',           // Task changes
  '.cleo/sessions.json',       // Session changes
  '.cleo/config.json',         // Config changes
  '.cleo/project-info.json',   // Health changes
  '.cleo/todo-log.jsonl',       // Audit events
  '.cleo/metrics/*.jsonl',     // Metric updates
];
```

On change, the watcher:
1. Invalidates cached data
2. Emits typed WebSocket event to all connected clients
3. Logs the event for debugging

### 7.4 Security

- Bind to `127.0.0.1` only (never `0.0.0.0`)
- No authentication for local access
- CORS restricted to localhost origins
- Path validation prevents directory traversal
- Read-only in Phase 1-2 (no file writes)
- Phase 3+ writes go through domain handler validation + atomic write pattern
- No arbitrary command execution from web requests

---

## 8. Available Domain Operations

The dashboard can leverage all 162 MCP domain operations across 10 domains:

| Domain | Query Ops | Mutate Ops | Dashboard Use |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| `tasks` | 17 | 13 | Task list, detail, hierarchy, graph, stats |
| `session` | 7 | 10 | Session list, focus, metrics, start/end |
| `system` | 19 | 11 | Health, config, version, diagnostics, dash |
| `validate` | 13 | 8 | Compliance summary, violations, test status |
| `lifecycle` | 9 | 9 | RCSD pipeline status, stage tracking |
| `release` | 3 | 9 | Release list, version, changelog, ship |
| `orchestrate` | 6 | 6 | Epic orchestration status, wave progress |
| `research` | 5 | 5 | Research artifacts, search, reports |
| `skills` | 6 | 6 | Installed skills, dispatch info |
| `issues` | 1 | 3 | Bug/feature filing (Phase 4) |
