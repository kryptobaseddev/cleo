# Release Protocol

<Warning>
**DEPRECATED** (v0.84.0): This page has been consolidated into `protocols/release.md`,
which is the single canonical reference for both LLM agents and human developers.
</Warning>

## Canonical Reference

**Agents**: Use `protocols/release.md` directly. It contains the complete release schema,
state machine, error codes, all 8 CLI subcommands, ship workflow, validation gates,
and platform changelog configuration.

**Humans**: See [Release Command Documentation](/commands/release) for usage examples
and troubleshooting, or read `protocols/release.md` for the full technical reference.

## What Moved Where

| Content | New Location |
|---------|-------------|
| Release JSON schema | `protocols/release.md` → Release Schema |
| State machine (3 states: planned/active/released) | `protocols/release.md` → State Machine |
| Error codes 50-59 | `protocols/release.md` → Error Codes |
| Task discovery pipeline (6 filters) | `protocols/release.md` → Task Discovery |
| CLI commands (8 subcommands) | `protocols/release.md` → CLI Commands |
| Ship workflow (10 steps) | `protocols/release.md` → Ship Workflow |
| All ship flags (--run-tests, --skip-validation, etc.) | `protocols/release.md` → CLI Commands → ship |
| Platform changelog config | `protocols/release.md` → Platform Changelog Configuration |
| Tag annotation fallback chain | `protocols/release.md` → Tag Annotation Fallback |
| Validation gates | `protocols/release.md` → Validation Gates |
| CI/CD integration | `protocols/release.md` → CI/CD Integration |
| init-ci and validate subcommands | `protocols/release.md` → CLI Commands |

## Removed Content

- `cleo release verify` -- use `cleo release ship --dry-run`
- `cleo release start` -- state transition is automatic during `ship`
- `cleo release note` -- use `cleo release plan --notes` or `cleo release create --notes`
