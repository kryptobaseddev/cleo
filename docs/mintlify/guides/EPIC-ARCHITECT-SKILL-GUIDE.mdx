# Epic Architect Skill Guide

**Version**: 2.1.0
**Status**: Active

---

## Quick Start

### Invoke the Skill

The ct-epic-architect skill activates when you ask Claude to:

```
"Create an epic for user authentication"
"Plan the epic for this feature"
"Decompose this project into tasks"
"Break down this work into manageable tasks"
"Architect the dependency structure"
```

Or use the slash command directly:

```
/ct-epic-architect
```

### What Happens

1. **Skill loads** - SKILL.md body (~490 lines) enters context
2. **References available** - Commands, patterns, examples accessible on-demand
3. **Epic created** - Full task hierarchy with dependencies
4. **Session started** - Scoped to the new epic
5. **Summary returned** - Minimal response preserves your context

## When to Use

### Use ct-epic-architect When

| Situation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| New feature needs breakdown | "Add authentication to the app" |
| Bug requires structured fix | "Fix the session corruption issue" |
| Research needs organization | "Investigate real-time collaboration options" |
| Migration needs phasing | "Migrate to multi-tenant architecture" |
| Sprint needs planning | "Plan tasks for the next sprint" |

### Don't Use ct-epic-architect When

| Situation | Better Alternative |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Single simple task | `cleo add "Task"` directly |
| Existing epic needs work | Resume session, `cleo focus set` |
| Understanding codebase | Use `cleo analyze`, research first |
| Quick fix needed | Just do the fix |

## Common Patterns

### Feature Epic

For new functionality:

1. Invoke `/ct-epic-architect`
2. Describe the feature and constraints
3. Let it create Wave 0 (foundation) → Wave N (integration)

**Example**: "Create an epic for JWT authentication with protected routes"

### Bug Epic

For structured bug fixes:

1. Invoke `/ct-epic-architect`
2. Describe the bug and severity
3. Get Investigation → Fix → Regression Test structure

**Example**: "Create a bug epic for the session data corruption issue. Severity: high."

### Research Epic

For structured investigation:

1. Invoke `/ct-epic-architect`
2. Describe research questions
3. Get Scope → Parallel Investigation → Synthesis structure

**Example**: "Create a research epic to compare Drizzle vs Prisma for our stack"

### Migration Epic

For multi-phase changes:

1. Invoke `/ct-epic-architect`
2. Describe the migration and safety requirements
3. Get phased structure with rollback checkpoints

**Example**: "Create a migration epic for adding tenant_id to all tables"

## Integration with Orchestrator

### Orchestrator Spawns ct-epic-architect

When operating as orchestrator, spawn ct-epic-architect for planning work:

```
Orchestrator receives complex request
    → Spawns ct-epic-architect subagent
    → ct-epic-architect creates tasks in CLEO
    → Returns manifest summary
    → Orchestrator continues with execution
```

### Skill-Aware Execution

See `references/skill-aware-execution.md` for:
- When subagents should have ct-epic-architect skill
- Research integration patterns
- Context protection strategies

## Output Files

### Epic Output

ct-epic-architect writes to:
```
claudedocs/agent-outputs/YYYY-MM-DD_epic-{slug}.md
```

### Manifest Entry

Appends to:
```
claudedocs/agent-outputs/MANIFEST.jsonl
```

### What's in the Manifest

```json
{
  "id": "epic-auth-2026-01-19",
  "key_findings": [
    "Created Epic T1234 with 6 child tasks",
    "Wave 0: [T1235]",
    "Wave 1: [T1236, T1237]",
    "Critical path: T1235 → T1236 → T1238 → T1240"
  ],
  "needs_followup": ["T1235"],
  "linked_tasks": ["T1234", "T1235", "T1236", "T1237", "T1238", "T1239", "T1240"]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Doesn't Activate

**Symptoms**: Claude doesn't use ct-epic-architect patterns

**Solutions**:
1. Use explicit trigger phrase: "create epic for..."
2. Use slash command: `/ct-epic-architect`
3. Check skill is installed: `ls skills/ct-epic-architect/SKILL.md`

### Tasks Created Without Dependencies

**Symptoms**: All tasks show as Wave 0

**Solutions**:
1. Be explicit about task order in your request
2. Ask for "dependency analysis"
3. Check examples for proper patterns

### Too Many Tasks Created

**Symptoms**: 20+ tasks for a small feature

**Solutions**:
1. Specify scope constraints upfront
2. Ask for "small/medium epic"
3. Request task consolidation after review

### Conflicting with Orchestrator

**Symptoms**: Both skills trying to control workflow

**Solutions**:
1. Orchestrator spawns ct-epic-architect, doesn't run concurrently
2. ct-epic-architect for planning, orchestrator for execution
3. Check `references/skill-aware-execution.md` for patterns
