# CLEO Documentation Index

This index defines long-term documentation authority and prevents strategic drift.

## Source of Truth Hierarchy

1. `docs/concepts/vision.mdx`  
   Immutable vision of what CLEO is.

2. `docs/specs/PORTABLE-BRAIN-SPEC.md`  
   Canonical normative contract for product identity, pillars, and invariants.

3. `README.md`  
   Operational public contract: what is shipped now and how to use it.

4. `docs/specs/CLEO-STRATEGIC-ROADMAP-SPEC.md`  
   Evidence-gated phase plan and progression criteria.

5. `docs/specs/CLEO-BRAIN-SPECIFICATION.md`  
   Detailed capability implementation target for BRAIN dimensions.

## Documentation Categories

- `docs/concepts/` - identity, principles, and architecture framing
- `docs/specs/` - normative and implementation specifications
- `docs/guides/` - operational workflows and integration guides
- `docs/commands/` - CLI command behavior and usage reference

## Non-Drift Rules

1. Current state claims MUST be verifiably shipped.
2. Planned features MUST be labeled as planned, gated, or experimental.
3. Canonical terms MUST remain consistent across docs:
   - Portable Memory
   - Provenance by Default
   - Interoperable Interfaces
   - Deterministic Safety
   - Cognitive Retrieval
4. Vision-level changes require synchronized updates to:
   - `docs/concepts/vision.mdx`
   - `docs/specs/PORTABLE-BRAIN-SPEC.md`
   - `README.md`
