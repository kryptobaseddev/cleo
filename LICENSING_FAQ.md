# CLEO Licensing FAQ

This document explains how CLEO is licensed and what that means for users,
contributors, and companies.

---

## What license does CLEO use?

CLEO is licensed under the **Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1)**.

This is a source-available license that allows free use for personal and
non-production purposes, while reserving commercial and production use for
licensed customers.

On **January 26, 2029**, CLEO will automatically convert to the
**Apache License 2.0**.

---

## Is CLEO open source?

Not yet.

BSL 1.1 is **not an Open Source license**. However, it guarantees that CLEO
will become open source on the Change Date.

After January 26, 2029, CLEO will be licensed under Apache 2.0.

---

## Can I use CLEO for personal projects?

Yes.

You may use CLEO for:
- Personal projects
- Learning and experimentation
- Evaluation and testing
- Open-source contributions
- Non-commercial internal exploration

No payment or permission is required for these uses.

---

## What counts as “production use”?

Production use includes any use of CLEO that:
- Provides value to customers or users
- Is part of a commercial product or service
- Is used internally by a company for ongoing operations
- Is offered as a hosted service or SaaS
- Is embedded in paid tooling or workflows

If you are unsure whether your use is production, assume that it is.

---

## Can my company use CLEO internally?

Internal company use is considered **production use** under BSL 1.1.

If your company wishes to use CLEO internally for real work, automation,
or operational workflows, a **commercial license is required**.

---

## Can I build a SaaS or hosted service using CLEO?

Not under the free license.

Offering CLEO as part of a hosted service, SaaS product, or managed platform
requires a **commercial license from CodLuv LLC**.

---

## Can I fork CLEO?

Yes, with restrictions.

You may fork CLEO for:
- Personal experimentation
- Non-production use
- Development and learning

You may **not**:
- Use a fork commercially
- Offer a competing product or service
- Circumvent the production-use restriction

All forks remain subject to the BSL 1.1 until the Change Date.

---

## Can I contribute to CLEO?

Yes.

By contributing, you agree that:
- Your contribution is licensed under BSL 1.1
- CodLuv LLC may commercialize CLEO during the BSL period
- Your contribution will convert to Apache 2.0 on the Change Date

This ensures CLEO can remain sustainable while still becoming open source.

---

## Will CLEO really become open source?

Yes. This is legally guaranteed by the license.

On **January 26, 2029**, CLEO will automatically be relicensed under
the **Apache License 2.0**, with no additional action required.

---

## Why not MIT, GPL, or AGPL?

- **MIT** does not protect against commercial exploitation
- **GPL/AGPL** restrict enterprise adoption and complicate integration
- **BSL** provides sustainability now and openness later

This model ensures CLEO can be maintained, supported, and improved long-term.
