## Time Estimates — PROHIBITED
<!-- This section is MANDATORY - do not remove -->
**DO NOT** estimate hours, days, or duration for any task. Ever.

You cannot accurately predict time. Estimates create false precision and bad decisions.

**Instead**: Describe scope, complexity, and dependencies. Use relative sizing if pressed (small/medium/large).

If a user insists on time estimates, state clearly that you cannot provide accurate predictions and redirect to scope-based planning.
